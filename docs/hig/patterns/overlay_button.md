# Overlay Button

![](/assets/overlay_button.png)

Use a Overlay Button for the most important action on a Window. The Overlay Button appears in front of all other content on Window, and is recognizable for its circle shape and icon in the center. Only use a Overlay Button for presenting a Window's primary action. The Overlay Button can be aligned left, center, or right.

There are 3 sizes of Overlay Buttons, Normal being the default:

1. Normal (50×50px, icon: 24px)
2. Small (34×34px, icon: 16px)
3. Large (90×90px, icon: 32px)

## Geometry

![](/assets/overlay_button_geo.png)

The Overlay Button is typically shown in a circle container, and the coloring of its background should be the app's accent color, and should contrast well with the background.

- It should by default be spaced 18px from all sides.
- Don't layer things on top of a Overlay Button.
- Ensure that the Overlay Button contrasts very well with the area behind it.

An icon in an Overlay Button should be understandable and clear. On hover, Overlay Buttons should display a tooltip showing what it does in one or 3 words maximum. It shouldn't contain notifications or actions seen elsewhere.

- Use clear and simple icons, such as `list-add-symbolic`, `chat-message-new-symbolic`, or `document-edit-symbolic`. Ensure that a tooltip is available for clarity.
- Don't use confusing or open-ended icons that suggest less common actions.

An Overlay Button can trigger an action either on the current Window, or it can perform an action that creates a new Window.
It promotes an important, constructive action such as:

- Create
- Favorite
- Share
- Start a process

### Small Overlay Button

This type of Overlay Button is used for secondary, supporting actions.

- If multiple important actions are necessary, use a small Overlay Button for those.
- Don't use multiple normal-sized Overlay Buttons as they might compete for attention.

### Large Overlay Button

This type of Overlay Button is used when the layout calls for a prominent action, when a larger footprint would aid in user engagement.

- Consider a large Overlay Button when there's a clear action to do in the user flow.
- Don't use a large Overlay Button if it will hide important UI when scrolling. Instead use a normal sized Overlay Button.

### Textual Overlay Button

This type of Overlay Button can be more effective where an icon alone might be too ambiguous in the View.

- Don’t use an Extended Overlay Button in a non-scrolling view.
- If a primary action is needed in a non-scrolling View, use a Button instead.

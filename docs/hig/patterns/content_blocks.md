# Content Block

![Content Block](/assets/content_blocks.png)

Content blocks show information by grouping content by category so it's easier to scan. They are colored #FAFAFA in light, and #0d0d0d in dark. There are three types:

1. Text + Controller: Title, subtitle, and two action buttons.
2. Image Cluster + Text: Multiple items provided in a line.
3. Image: One item provided as an image.

## Mini Content Block

When space is at a premium, and doesn't fit information well with Content Blocks, one should use Mini Content Blocks. There are two types:

1. Text + Controller: Contains one action button, title and subtitle.
2. Image: One item provided as an image.

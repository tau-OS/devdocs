# Toasts

![](/assets/toast.png)

Toasts are Banners that are dismissable and transient to the View. They may contain an action button.

## Guidelines

- Use a toast for messages in the context of a View in an app. Typical usage is for giving feedback to a user action. For example, after doing a destructive action, a toast showing an undo sentence and button.

- Toasts are transient so they're best suited for informing the user of events, as opposed to ongoing states. For the latter, use Banners.

- Toasts are only useful while the app is being focused. For messaging the user while the app is unfocused, consider using a Notification.

- Each Toast should have a clear, simple and concise title.

- Toasts should only include a button when necessary.

- Toast titles should use Informal Heading style.

# Dialog

![](/assets/dialog.png)

Dialogs interrupt users with urgent information, details, or actions. Common usage includes confirming a destructive action, or informing the user of something instantly.

- A dialog should not exceed 400 units in width and height.

- A dialog is modal with the Window, and displays a scrim behind it.

- A dialog fades in, and scales up from 80% to 100% (its final size.) A background scrim fades in, in front of app content.

- A dialog stays in focus and does not scroll until the user has dismissed or gone through with its associated confirmation.

- A dialog should not contain, or make happen, scrollable contents.

Remember these extra guidances as well for messaging in dialogs:

**Say what happened** — Make it clear what did/didn’t happen. Explain why the user got this error, even if the only explanation is technical.

**Provide reassurance** — Where possible, let them know what was not affected by the error.

**Be empathetic** — Still use “please” if the situation warrants it. Maybe it’s a really dire situation, so empathize.

**Help them fix it** — Tell them exactly what to do if there’s a way to possibly fix it.

**Always give a way out** — If they can’t fix the problem, provide them with a way to contact.
